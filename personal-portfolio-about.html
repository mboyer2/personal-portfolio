	<b>1.) How did you first learn screen-printing?</b>
</p>
</div>

<p>I learned screen-printing at overnight camp. I was 10 or 11 and it was the most basic kind of screen-printing. Screen-printing takes this photo-emulsion process …this very advanced, chemical, scientific process, but at camp…you just cut out a stencil with an x-acto knife. So that’s kinda how I learned it.  You’d take your screen, you’d pay your two dollars for your shirt, and you’d make one t-shirt.</p>
